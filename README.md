Refinite Autoresponder
==================

## Introduction

Refinite Autoresponder will be focused on providing a renewal of the [Infinite Autoresponder](http://infinite.ibasics.biz/) code and a facelift for the aging user interface. The Infite Autresponder was originally written by Aaron Colman years ago. It provides a free PHP platform for creating email dripping marketing campaigns. While there are many commercial alternatives available, Infinite Responder has been one of the few free open source applications that provide this functionality.

Unfortunately, time has taken it's toll on the codebase and it's user interface leaves room for improvement. The latest version available from the Infinite Responder website has seen it's last update on 8/3/2007. In 2014, constantly evolving platforms en technologies provide options for vastly improving Infinite Responder.

Additionally to improving the product itself, the aim is to enhance the service around the product aswell. Maintenance has stopped, there is no bugtracker available, forums have been closed down and support is (almost) nill. The website and download provide as simple manual but has no documentation of the inner workings of the product or provide any insight into use case scenarios.

## Goals

Providing a stable, usable, free and open source application for setting up email dripping marketing campaings. The following objectives have been set:

- Continually
  - Provide a drop in replacement for Infinite Autoresponder
  - Create a free and open source option for email marketing campaings
- First
  - Gradually improving the maintainability and stability of the codebase
  - Add unit testing for functionality
  - Add technical documentation
- Next
  - Enhance usability by updating the web interface to modern standards
  - Improving first-time-user experience by simplifying install and getting started
